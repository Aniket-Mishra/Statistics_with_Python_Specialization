    "# Fitting a Multilevel Model\n",
    "This analysis will be focusing on a longitudinal study that was conducted on children with autism<sup>1</sup>. We will be looking at several variables and exploring how different factors interact with the socialization of a child with autism as they progress throughout the beginning stages of their life.\n",
    "\n",
    "The variables we have from the study are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* AGE is the age of a child which, for this dataset, is between two and thirteen years \n",
    "* VSAE measures a child's socialization \n",
    "* SICDEGP is the expressive language group at age two and can take on values ranging from one to three. Higher values indicate more expressive language.\n",
    "* CHILDID is the unique ID that is given to each child and acts as their identifier within the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "We will first be fitting a multilevel model with explicit random effects of the children to account for the fact that we have repeated measurements on each child, which introduces correlation in our observations.\n",

    "We can see that the estimates for the parameters are relatively consistent among each of the modeling methodologies, but the standard errors differ from model to model. Overall, the two GEE models are mostly similar and both exhibit standard errors for parameters that are slightly larger than each of their corresponding values in the OLS model. The multilevel model has the largest standard error for the age coefficient, but the smallest standard error for the intercept. Overall, we see that we would make similar inferences regarding the importance of these fixed effects, but remember that we need to interpret the multilevel models estimates conditioning on a given child. For example, considering the age coefficient in the multilevel model, we would say that as age increases by one year *for a given child* in the first expressive language group, VSAE is expected to increase by 2.73. In the GEE and OLS models, we would say that as age increases by one year *in general*, the average VSAE is expected to increase by 2.60."
